Protect your worpdress with two-factor authentication based on face recognition service provided by FACE2.in.
FACE2 provides a hosted face recognition service that allows developers to use simple REST API interface to authenticate users. It is based on HTML5's webcam access method. We also added a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting HTML5 video tag's camera access, such as mobile Safari found in Apple's iOS (iPhone/iPad). We called the way it works for iOS "Selfie based authentication".
